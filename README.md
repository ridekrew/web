In order to run, use npm install in the root directory. Then, navigate into the client folder and run npm install again. 

This will create two node_modules folders (one for client dependencies, and one for server dependencies).

For development, run "npm start" inside the client folder in one terminal window. Open another terminal window and navigate to the root directory.

From there, run "npm install -g nodemon" and one it is complete, run "nodemon server.js".
